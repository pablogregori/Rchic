#' @description Reads the data, prepare the data and call similarityTree.
#' @details 
#' This function allows you to compute the similarity tree. The similarity measure is symetric. At the end of the computation we obtain the similarity tree, 
#' as follows. In this tree, couple of variables are gathered according to their similarity measure. Significant levels
#' are highlighted in red. A significant level means that the considered level is more significant than the previous level
#' and than the next one. In the following figure and in all the cases, an expert must choose according to his knowledge
#' what is the threshold in the similarity tree after which the similarity measure is not significant for the data considered.
#' In general the last classes in the similarity tree are not significant. On this figure, we can remark that the strongest 
#' class is: strong powerful. In this case, this two variables are very similar. The 
#' second strongest class is: large heavy.
