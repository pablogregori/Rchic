Description: This package is intented to implement all the features of
    Statistical Implicative Analysis. This theory aims at building association
    rules of the form : if an object has the property A it also tends to have
    the property B. The SIA builds confidence of rules by computing the number
    of counter examples of such an rule and then by measuring the surprise
    (or the probability) to have so few counter examples compared to the number
    of counter examples we would have with two random variables have the same
    sizes (than A and B). With Rchic you can build a similirity tree (using
    similarity analysis), an implicative graph and a hierarchical tree.
