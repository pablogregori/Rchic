Description: This package is intented to implement all the features of Statistical Implicative Analysis. This theory aims 
at building association rules of the form : if an object has the property A it also tends to have the property B.
The SIA builds confidence of rules by computing the number of counter examples of such an rule and then by measuring
the surprise  (or the probability) to have so few counter examples compared to the number of counter examples we woulc 
have with two random variables have the same sizes (than A and B).
With Rchic you can build a similirity tree (using similarity analysis), an implicative graph and a hierarchical tree.

Currently I put some news.

A first version of the implicative graph is working.
To use it, you need to go in the directory tests and run the file ImplicativeGraph.R

A first version of the similarity tree is also working with the computation of the significant levels
To use it, you need to go in the directory tests and run the file SimilarityTree.R
